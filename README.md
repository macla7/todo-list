# todo-list

Thinking of a new 'convention' of mine. All my variable names being first 3 letters of key words. ie proDes will be 'project description'. Two current exceptions will be 'list' and 'lis'. 'lis' will be for listener.. 'list' will signify a list. And, 'cont' will be container.

form will still be 'form'.

Content Editable: My assumption, without looking it up too much, is that there is security concerns using this, to directly store data.. alas, just having fun.

Few more things to do:
  - Make hide todo EL DONE
  - Make complete todo EL
  - Get Rid of Priority on Projects DONE
  - Configure local save.
